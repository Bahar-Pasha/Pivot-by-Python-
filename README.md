# Pivot-by-Python-
This Python script utilizes the pandas library to process data from an Excel file containing media sales records. It filters the data based on specified criteria such as date range, brand, category, and region. Additionally, it performs data manipulation tasks such as combining certain user names. Finally, it creates a pivot table summarizing sales quantities by user, zone, state, and model, and exports the result to a new Excel file.
